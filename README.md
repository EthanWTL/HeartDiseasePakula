## Description

Welcome aboard! 

We are dedicated data scientists working on this Data Science Reserach Project. 

It has a focus on implement Federated Learning on [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) to help early stage detection of Cardiovasular Disease.

## Stage I: Baseline Modeling

To create a baseline understanding of the project as well as testing our data cleaning accuracy, we delpoyed a set of traditional machine learning technique, the results for Cleveland datasets are shown as following.
